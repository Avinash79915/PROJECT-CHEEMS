            Inspired from the famous ‘Dogelore’ (which refers to the meme universe featuring dogs), these meme pages, which had names involving the term ‘cheems’ like ‘Cheemsdaa’ or ‘Cheems Rajah’, were published with a variety of dogs as funny characters that come with elaborate storylines. If it was not the IPL, then the dogs in the meme-world would talk about bunking classes and heading to Marina beach or engaging in a hot discussion around the Schrodinger’s cat-like status of arrear exams in Tamil Nadu.

          <p2>  Dogelore originated from a meme dating back to 2013, featuring Kabosu, a Shiba Inu breed of dog. Kabosu is the main character ‘Doge’ in dogelore. ‘Cheems’ is another dog based on a dog named Balltze. In the original meme, Cheems is characterised by adding a stray ‘m’ or a ‘b’ in words, calling a cheeseburger, ‘cheemsburbger’ for example. Perro is a lab-retriever pup mix in the 'dogelore' universe and is Spanish. In the original world, it is the drug dealer and is associated with the word ‘Quieres,’ which means ‘Do you want?’ in Spanish. ‘Walter’ is a tall dog, characterised by its extraordinarily large nose and occasionally a wide smile. Karen, Lil Bro and cousin Bro are all Doge’s relatives, as per the dogelore.
